##Week 1 (13/05/2024 to 19/05/2024)##
For the project "Gasifier Refractor Life Predictor," Hiren Modhvadia completed prerequisite coursework on gasifier refractor operations, collected comprehensive operational data (temperature, pressure, gas composition), and learned about slag composition and operational data related to slag. Additionally, Hiren finished an online course on machine learning to understand relevant software and technology.
- Completed prerequisite coursework
- Collected operational data
- Learned about slag composition
- Finished an online ML course

##Week 2 (20/05/2024 to 27/05/2024)##
For the project "Gasifier Refractor Life Predictor," Hiren Modhvadia focused on data cleaning, including handling missing values through identification, imputation, deletion, and forward/backward fill techniques. Additionally, duplicate records were identified and removed, and outliers were detected and handled using statistical methods and visualization techniques. Hiren also attended a two-day orientation on the workings of the IT Division at Jamnagar Manufacturing Division (JMD), learning about telecommunications, network infrastructure, cybersecurity, and database management.
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicate records
- Detected and handled outliers
- Attended IT Division orientation

##Week 3 (28/05/2024 to 06/06/2024)##
For the project "Gasifier Refractor Life Predictor," Hiren Modhvadia selected the Random Forest model for predicting gasifier refractor life, gathered additional data on pressure and temperature, utilized the `sklearn.ensemble` module for implementation, achieved a model accuracy of 97% through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, and deployed the model using a Power BI dashboard for real-time monitoring.
- Selected Random Forest model
- Gathered additional data
- Utilized `sklearn.ensemble`
- Achieved 97% model accuracy
- Deployed model with Power BI

##Week 4 (07/06/2024 to 14/06/2024)##
Hiren Modhvadia worked on the "Data Centre Management Services Dashboard Project," creating a compliance report for the PGP server, requesting necessary data, normalizing data using Excel queries and functions, and preparing SQL queries for server health parameters, common parameter matching, and identifying servers with null values.
- Created compliance report
- Normalized data
- Prepared SQL queries
